Through DIMS3, the US Agency for International Development, Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean, Office of Regional Sustainable Development, Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance team (USAID/LAC/RSD/DRG) aims to support citizen-responsive governance and democratic development with rigorous public opinion research on democratic norms, attitudes, and experiences in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region.  This will be achieved through four primary work streams: 1) collaborative, periodic, innovative public opinion surveys and research on democratic values, behaviors, and perceptions in LAC; 2) dissemination of data, analysis, and research about democratic norms and attitudes in LAC; 3) support and development of innovative topics and methodologies in public opinion research and analysis; and 4) building the local capacity of researchers and institutions on survey design, data collection, data analysis and reporting, and evidence based policy making. The foundation of these efforts is longitudinal, country, and comparative cross-national trend analysis on topics relevant to the democracy sector in LAC, such as democratic norms and values, perceptions of institutions, and experiences with corruption, crime victimization, and migration.

The program\\'s objective is to enable an environment for Nicaraguas transition to democracy. The purpose of this task order is to provide rapid, responsive, and relevant analytical and technical assistance that bridge efforts to create the conditions for, and support, a peaceful transition to democracy in Nicaragua. It will operate through two primary work streams: 1) state-of-the-art, gender-informed analytical work, assessments, research and special studies; results management support; and training that contribute to sector learning in the country and builds an evidence base for broader programing, and 2) targeted short-term technical and analytical activities during Nicaraguas transition that require rapid response programming support until other funds, mechanisms, and actors can be mobilized. The scope of these two work streams is across multiple democracy, human rights, and governance (DRG) sub-sectors relevant to a successful and peaceful transition to democracy in Nicaragua. RAIN will pursue these activities against a variety of scenarios generally falling under three categories: 1. Free, fair and transparent elections lead to an orderly transition. 2. A sudden political transition occurs following a crisis. 3. Transition does not happen in an orderly and timely manner.

The eastern seaboard of Uruguay includes a chain of 5 coastal lagoons, supporting globally important populations of migratory shorebirds that use the surrounding grasslands, wetlands and sandy areas, as well as the lagoon shores, as wintering areas. This region, covering 2,471,000 acres, is under pressure by threats such as agriculture, intensive livestock ranching, urbanization and recreational activities such as uncontrolled tourism. Partners will secure long-term shorebird conservation by developing and empowering an integrative collaborative local conservation network with landowners and other key stakeholders taking direct action on habitat conservation and restoration. Acting jointly with key stakeholders of the region, the management of the 5 lagoons will be integrated by creating local and regional working groups to subscribe local and cross-site management and conservation agreements. Primary actions will include the application of Best Management Practices in 98,800 acres, habitat restoration in 490 acres, Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site designations, shorebird population estimates, the building of high-resolution distribution maps, as well as the development of a citizen scientist group that safeguards habitat integrity for neotropical migrant shorebirds. Finally, partners will put together all the experience, contacts, and information to develop a regional plan for shorebird conservation for the lagoon belt.
