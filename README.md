# 2023_DSKUS

The Data Science South Korea/US (DSKUS) Global Lab is a cross-national project between Hanyang University (project lead) in Seoul, DePaul University, and Indiana University. The program is funded by a grant from the United States Embassy in Seoul (via the US State Department). Teams of students from the three universities will work together to solve unique data science challenges with real-world implications. As part of the program, eight DePaul students will travel to Seoul to meet face-to-face with their team members and to interact with industry leaders in data science and AI. Similarly a group of Hanyang University students will spend a week in Chicago to learn about data science and AI applications in US organizations. Travel and accommodation expenses are covered by the grant, students also receive a small stipend to participate in the program.

Activities
Twenty-four students from both countries will work from March 1, 2023 to June 24th, 2023 on exciting data science projects tackling international policy challenges of interest to both countries. Student teams will include two Hanyang University students and two students from DePaul University or Indiana University. Each global team will have an industry mentor and an academic mentor that will oversee the work and provide feedback. DePaul MS in Data Science students can use this project toward the degree capstone requirement.  Projects will be selected by each team and will focus on one of the following ideas:

So, our project was: 

Partnering to provide responsible, well-targeted development assistance around the world, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America â€¦ how and where should foreign aid be targeted to return the biggest benefits. 

Our goal was to provide the US embassy with insights of what will be Targeted, Responsible Aid to the recipient country and this is inspired by the difficult that the US State Department experiences.
